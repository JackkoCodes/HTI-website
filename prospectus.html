    As part of our fundraising efforts, we're offering a collection of sponsorship packages for interested companies and
    organisations. As a sponsor, you'll be helping bring over 2,000 makers across the nation together and, as part of
    that, have an opportunity to connect with them and get the word about what you're making.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are our standard sponsorship packages:
  </p>
  <p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Tier</th>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Gold ($15,000+)</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>A one to two minute message at the start of every event.</li>
          <li>Multiple "Featured" posts on our social media.</li>
          <li>For a negotiable additional amount, have the event co-branded as "Present by X".</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Silver ($10,000+)</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Hand out flyers and swag to attending makers.</li>
          <li>Include a two to three sentence message in our pre-event emails.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bronze ($5,000+)</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Your logo will be on our website, the converted minibus, and our social medias.</li>
          <li>You can send engineers to any of our events and they can meet fellow makers.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </p>
